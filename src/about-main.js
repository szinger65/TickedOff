          About TickedOff
        </h1>
        <div className="space-y-4 text-slate-600 leading-relaxed">
          <p>
            TickedOff isn't just another to-do list. It is a philosophy of productivity designed 
            to bridge the gap between your daily grind and your life's biggest ambitions.
          </p>
          <p>
            I believe that small daily taks should directly 
            contribute to your long term goals. When you can see the progress bar move 
            on a life goal just by checking off a daily chore, motivation becomes automatic.
          </p>
          <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-slate-900 pt-4">Why I built this</h2>
          <p>
            Traditional productivity tools are lists of endless obligations. TickedOff is a 
            game where you are the protagonist. Earn points, build streaks, and watch 
            your profile grow as you conquer your day.
